Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
--------
Overview of the analysis:
--
For this analysis of the Pewlett-Hackard employees, we noticed that there were a lot of employees who were near the retirement age. in this order the creation of
unique_titles.csv that contains the employee number, name, and title of employees who nearing the retiremnt age. using this table, the creation. of
retiring_titles.csv was possible, this table contained the number of employees for each job title that fell within the age for retiring employees. This gives an
idea of the total number of employees that will be leaving the work force soon. 
lastly, the creation of the mentorship_eligibility.csv, which showed us how many employees are eleigible for mentoring and training.

Results:
--
please find below a sample of the unique_titles and mentorship_eligibility tables from deliverables 1 and 2.

Within the unique_titles table, we have included all employees that were born between during the year 1952-1955. 

The mentorship_eligibility table only includes current employees who were born in the year 1965, but excludes all those who were included in the unique_titles
table.
To include the older, and possibly more experienced employees who are ready for retirement in the mentorship_eligibility table, we should expand the birth date from
1952-1965 for mentorship_eligibility. This more inclusive table will be called extended_mentorship_eligibility.

Summary:
--------
The company is currently looking at offering retirement packages for it's near retirement age employees. It's also starting to think about what positions will need to be filled due to those retirements.

Currently, there is over 80K employees expected to be eligible for retirement. This means that Pewlett Hackard will be facing an approx of 30% of its employees to retire in the next few years to come. that large worforce needs replacements, wether it is a quaified human for the position or machines/AI with minimum human interference replacement.

in anticipation of this great employees loss to age, Pewlett Hackard has decided to keep some of them as "mentors" a new position that will help train the new staff coming in, and make them as good as the old leaving.
